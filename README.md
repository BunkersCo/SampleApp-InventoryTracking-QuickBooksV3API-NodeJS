# SampleApp-InventoryTracking-QuickBooksV3API-NodeJS

<p>This is a sample application which illustrates a typical use case in QBO.  It is built on mcohen01's excellent open source NodeJS SDK for QuickBooks Online.  Please visit this <a herf="https://github.com/mcohen01/node-quickbooks#findAccounts">repo</a> for more information.</p> 

<p>The use case being demonstrated by this sample is the following:  Login -> populate list of Customers and Items -> Select a customer and item, quantity, and amount -> Create the invoice<p>

<p>There is also an additional flow for creating an inventory item.<p>

<p>Several routes have been created for functions such as Item Search, Account Search, Invoice Creation, Item Creation.  </p>

<h2>Invoice Creation</h2>

<p>This flow works the following way.<br>

   <ol>
   <li> adafasafssdaffsadf
    </li>
    
    
    <li>fassadfsasafsadf
    </li>


<li>Once the requests are complete, we render createInvoice.ejs</li>
</p>
